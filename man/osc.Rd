\usage{
osc(A, K = 2, model = "pabm", assortative = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Adjacency matrix describing an undirected graph.}

\item{K}{Number of communities.}

\item{model}{Type of block model (SBM, DCBM, or PABM).
The dimensionality of the embedding of A depends on this model.
If the model is SBM or DCBM, then the embedding dimension is K.
If the model is PABM, then the embedding dimension is \eqn{K^2}
and \eqn{p = K (K + 1) / 2} and \eqn{q = K (K - 1) / 2}.}

\item{assortative}{Whether the block model is assortative or disassortative.
Only valid for SBM and DCBM. This argument is ignored for PABM.
If assortative is TRUE, then p = K and q = 0.
If assortative is FALSE, then p = 1 and q = K - 1.
If assortative is an integer, then p is the value of that integer and
q = K - p.}
}
\value{
clustering, the cluster assignments, and B, the affinity matrix.
affinity.matrix, the affinity matrix of OSC.
embedding, the unscaled ASE of A.
